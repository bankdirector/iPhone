With the changing regulatory environment, bank executive teams and boards are spending more time on legal and compliance issues in banking. The following is a brief compilation of whatâ€™s ahead in banking law, liability and compliance that you need to know as a member of a bank board.</p>

		<p class="wrap story">To improve fraud protection, U.S. credit card companies will adopt the EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) technology, which uses a built-in microprocessor chip. Each transaction creates a unique identifying number, so criminals can no longer steal just a credit card number in order to make fraudulent purchases. In October, 2015, banks are liable for fraudulent transactions if they have not issued EMV cards and the merchant has EMV-compliant point of sale (POS) terminals. If the bank issues EMV cards but the merchant does not have EMV-compliant POS terminals, the merchant is liable. </p>

		<p class="wrap story">New disclosure rules for mortgages go into effect August 1, 2015, which will make the old HUD-1 statements largely null and void. A combined form under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act is designed to make mortgages easier for borrowers to understand. Lenders will be liable for any mistakes in disclosure rules implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so some banks are taking over responsibility from title companies for creating and delivering closing documents to borrowers. </p>
