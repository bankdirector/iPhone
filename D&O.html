		<p class="first no-indent"><strong>When it comes to liability insurance, all too often the vulnerability of directors and officers gets lost in the details, and that can lead to big personal losses.</strong></p>
		<p>Few banks are willing to even offer a deposit account to a marijuana business in the growing number of states where marijuana is now legal, and even fewer are willing to speak publicly about doing so. Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, and banks and their officers and directors could face criminal prosecution for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering or other criminal activities. The U.S. Department of Justice and FinCEN, an arm of the U.S. Treasury Department which enforces the Bank Secrecy Act, have issued guidance clarifying their positions on prosecuting marijuana businesses and the entities that serve them, but that has done little to swing the financial doors open for an industry estimated to have generated $2.7 billion in legalized sales in 2014.</p>
		<p>In one scenario, featuring the failed Bank of Lincolnwood in Illinois, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) directly sued some of the former officers and directors, eventually settling with four of them at various dates in 2012 and 2013. The defendants were required to pay amounts ranging from $65,000 to $125,000, according to agreements posted on the FDIC’s website. The bottom line is—when a policy comes up short—directors with any personal assets become fair game for plaintiffs.</p>
		<p>“If there isn’t an insurance policy and you have a significant net worth—guess what—you are the target,” says Tom Vartanian, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in  Washington, D.C. “Directors need to understand that once they go on the board, they have put that money on the table.” 
		<p>These days, even though the market for directors and officers liability (D&amp;O) insurance for banks has softened, with ample number of carriers and declining rates, bank directors must be as diligent as ever with regard to making sure they are the least exposed as possible. There are always plenty of issues for directors to consider when renewing a policy or stepping on a bank board for the first time, details that might turn into nightmares many years from now. </p>
		<p>Last year, 49 lawsuits related to management and professional liability at financial institutions were filed, down slightly from 51 a year earlier, according to Advisen, a research firm. The cases, mostly in federal court, included 20 merger objection lawsuits, the most common type of filing in 2014. In addition, there are ongoing D&amp;O lawsuits stemming from FDIC actions against failed banks. The FDIC had filed 105 lawsuits naming 800 former directors and officers as of Feb. 25 this year, dating back to Jan. 1, 2009.</p>

			<h4>The Three Sides to D&amp;O</h4>
			<p class="no-indent bottom-b pad-b margin-b"><strong>SIDE A.</strong> This coverage kicks in when a company cannot or will not indemnify the board member. It covers the personal assets of directors, officers and employees. There’s generally no retention, or deductible, since the goal is to protect the net worth of the individuals.</p>
			<p class="no-indent bottom-b pad-b margin-b"><strong>SIDE B.</strong> This covers directors, officers and employees if the company is able to indemnify them. A retention applies to this type of coverage.</p>
			<p class="no-indent pad-b"><strong>SIDE C.</strong> This covers the corporation, and is generally used for insurance claims. The retention is typically bundled with Side B.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity breaches have emerged as a new threat, with a few lawsuits filed against directors over data breaches at their companies, most notably at Target Corp. and a few others. They have yet to fully manifest themselves in terms of liability case law. In the boardroom, the fear is there. Directors could be in the crosshairs of plaintiffs’ lawyers, notes Scott Jenkins, a director for Bryn Mawr Bank Corp., a $2.1 billion asset financial institution based in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. “Ubiquitous in every discussion today is cyber,” he says. “It’s like anything else. It spills over and ultimately it’s the director’s fault.”</p>
		<p>On the good side, the D&amp;O market for financial institutions is as stable as it has ever been since the credit crisis. Premium renewal rates for financial institutions this year are down about 5 percent, according to Marsh, an insurance broker based in New York. For those banks that had rates hiked significantly post financial crisis, prices have come down much more than that. Large banks can generally purchase up to $1 billion on limits, notes Thomas Orrico, a managing director and head of the financial institutions practice at Marsh’s financial and professional liability division. “There is much more competition to write D&amp;O insurance for banks,” he says. “There is also general willingness to ensure and enhance coverage.”</p>
		<p>That said, boards need to dig into the policies written for them, while leaning on brokers as a key source to guide them, notes Kristin Roger, chief underwriting officer for Travelers Cos., an insurer based in Hartford, Connecticut. “The board needs to be very aware of their risk and that they are actively trying to manage that risk. These are not easy policies to understand; they are not off the rack.”
		<p>Given all the risks a bank faces, here are a few things to consider to better shield directors and officers from unforeseeable events: </p>
		<div class="bul">
			<p>Limits</p>
		</div>
		<p>Make sure the limits of liability are adequate. Policies often are renewed without much attention to detail, Vartanian notes. “If there is insurance, it’s basically a negotiation about how much, if not all, of the insurance proceeds the FDIC can get,” he says. A limit such as $5 million could cover legal fees for as little as six months, depending on the case. “Some people haven’t rethought the limits of liability in 25 years on their policies,” he adds. “The question is, ‘Where are you, and how much coverage do you have?’” </p>
		<p>Also, make sure the limits stand alone, adds Kevin LaCroix, an attorney and executive vice president at RT ProExec, a division of Chicago-based insurance brokerage R-T Specialty. “If the limits are shared with other lines of insurance, there may not be enough in one of those bad situations where there are multiple, simultaneous claims,” LaCroix says.  </p>
		<p>To help determine amounts, brokers can help. Some have been supplying more modeling, using analytics and peer benchmark data, looking for correlations to lawsuits and variables such as market capitalization and debt to help predict the probability of a lawsuit over the next 12 months, giving clients a loss distribution to help set limits. This helps directors see what a loss would look like and the average settlement given the characteristics of their bank, Orrico says. </p>
		<div class="bul">
			<p>Regulatory Exclusions</p>
		</div>
		<p>In the current environment, even banks operating under a consent order can get regulatory coverage. An exclusion, however, can do a lot of damage, LaCroix notes. “That’s a very harsh term to put on a policy,” he says. “Often the type of claim [excluded] would be something brought by a regulator.” Directors also need to pay attention to the definition of what a claim is, Orrico adds. If it’s not broad enough, then the insurance might not pay for legal expenses relating to regulatory investigations. </p>
		<div class="bul">
			<p>Pending and Prior Litigation</p>
		</div>
		<p>Insurers will also try to exclude events arising from past litigation. Try to make sure the agreement will include D&amp;O lawsuits from these events. “Some exclusions can be very broad and knock out everything,” Orrico says. “You have to be very careful.”</p>
		<div class="bul">
			<p>Run-Off Policies for Sellers</p>
		</div>
		<p>Typically an acquiring institution will want to fold a target bank’s board into its own policy, under the impression it will save money, notes Roger. But many policies will include an insured versus insured exclusion, which precludes claims of one insured against another. That might end up a nightmare for the board of the seller if the acquiring bank decides to later sue them. “Once you add another board to your policy, you are now insured,” Roger says. “Now they are all stuck, because the insurance isn’t going to respond in the event the acquiring company sues the board of the old company.” To remain covered, boards of the seller should insist that there is a separate run-off policy that covers them for future events, Roger advises. </p>
		<div class="bul">
			<p>Meetings With the Underwriter</p>
		</div>
		<p>Face-to-face meetings with an insurer before renewing or buying a policy can help lower premiums, Orrico notes. “You need to be as transparent as possible, meeting your insurer to tell them the bank’s story, and differentiate its D&amp;O risk profile. That will ultimately benefit the bank when securing insurance,” he says.</p><p>In all, with D&amp;O insurance, make sure the details are covered. “The board [members] need to be very aware of the risk and that they are actively trying to manage that risk, and that they are not just sticking their head in the sand,” Roger says.</p>
